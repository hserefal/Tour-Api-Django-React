# Overview

Indietravel.co are building a SaaS platform to help tour hosts to collate and distribute their experiences from one place. 

## Requirement

We would like you to build one Django API route, that provides the following data back:

* tour company
* tour title
* tour description
* tour dates
* tour price

This should be displayed via a React app, when viewed on a web browser.

The final application should be built as part of a Docker container.

### Notes

* Django to be used for the API - third party libraries are free to use
* React app to be used with Axios / Material-UI only.
* There is no need for styles or anything beyond functional HTML/JS.
* Need to provide authentication between React & Django.

### Delivery

Fork this repository, create your code, and then submit a pull request with your submission into your own branch.
